# London Housing Price Trends (1998â€“2018)

This project analyzes how average housing prices have evolved across Londonâ€™s 32 boroughs over a twenty-year period (1998â€“2018).  

Using publicly available housing data, the notebook calculates annual mean prices per borough, identifies the areas with the highest overall and relative growth, and visualizes these trends with clear bar-chart comparisons.  

The analysis highlights how all boroughs saw substantial appreciation in home values, with particularly strong percentage growth in outer districts such as Hackney and Waltham Forest, while central boroughs like Kensington & Chelsea and Westminster remain the most expensive in absolute terms.
